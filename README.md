<h1 align="center">MY First Project</h1> 
<p><b>Description:</b> In this project, I was testing a web application. I got 5 reports that imitated bugs found by customers. My task was to recreate these bugs, and write a Bug report in Jira.</p>

<tt>NOTE: Please bear in mind that this was my first step as a tester. I was just learning how to write Test cases and Bug reports, so that's why I was using my native language. Now I'm confident in writing TC & BR, So I'm using English in all my work. If You want to check my Test cases and Bug reports in English, please press right the icon on my Profile ðŸ˜‰</tt>
